# classification of handwritten digits using MNIST dataset on kaggle

train file contains details of each pixel which we will use to train our classifier <br/>
test file contains details of each pixel value with which we will test our SVM classifier<br/>
train.py will be used to train our classifier and the trained model will be stored in model.pickle file for later use<br/>
test.py will be used to predict the values in our test.csv file and store it in file submit.xlsx. do note that on kaggle we will have to submit csv file so we will have to convert .xlsx file to .csv file<br/>
we can do it by clicking on this link:  <a>https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer</a> <br/>

after we have converted the submit.xlsx file to submit.csv then we can upload our solutions to kaggle <br/>

## NOTE:
the no of data on which we train our classifier the more accurate our prediction will be but it will also take time<br/>
approx it will be about 15-20 mins to train about 40,000 train data but this may vary depending upon the configuration of your data<br/>
